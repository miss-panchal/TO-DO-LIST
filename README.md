# TO-DO-LIST

A to-do list is a simple web page element that allows users to input and manage a list of tasks or items. It is a practical and straightforward way to organize tasks, as well as a good exercise for practicing HTML and CSS skills. A to-do list created using only HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or other programming languages, is often referred to as a "pure CSS to-do list."
To get started, we will first need to create a basic HTML file. In this file, we will include the main structure for our To-Do list.

After creating the files just paste the following below codes into your file. Make sure to save your HTML document with a .html extension, so that it can be properly viewed in a web browser.

This is the basic structure of our To-Do list using HTML, and now we can move on to styling it using CSS.

Once the basic HTML structure of the To-Do list is in place, the next step is to add styling to the list using CSS. CSS allows us to control the visual appearance of the To-Do list, including things like layout, color, and typography.

Next, we will create our CSS file. We will use some basic CSS rules in this file to create our to-do list. We will also add some padding and margin properties to ensure that everything looks correct.

This will give our to-do list an upgraded presentation. Create a CSS file with the name of styles.css and paste the given codes into your CSS file. Remember that you must create a file with the .css extension.
